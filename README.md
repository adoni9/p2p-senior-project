Executive Summary

The project, P2P E-commerce Platform with Secure Payments, addresses the growing need for a decentralized and secure marketplace that enables users to buy and sell goods directly, without the reliance on centralized authorities. The existing e-commerce platforms often face issues like high transaction fees, security risks, and inefficiencies in logistics. This project aims to overcome these challenges by offering a peer-to-peer platform that enhances transaction security and fosters trust between users.
The platform integrates modern technologies like secure payment gateways (Chapa), real-time location-based notifications to ensure a seamless user experience. Additionally, it incorporates OTP-based email verification and JWT for secure user authentication, ensuring data protection and minimizing the risk of fraud.
The proposed system offers several key benefits like enhanced security by leveraging secure payment gateways and authentication mechanisms, users can confidently carry out financial transactions. The platform lowers the entry barrier for small-scale sellers and ensures a user-friendly interface for buyers and sellers alike.
This innovative solution has the potential to significantly transform peer-to-peer online marketplaces, providing a secure, efficient, and accessible environment for users to engage in commerce. It also contributes to the digital transformation of e-commerce by encouraging wider market participation and promoting trust through secure transactions.
